# resume-screening-ml

Automated Resume Screening using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

This project demonstrates how to use ML and NLP techniques to automatically rank and screen resumes based on their relevance to a given job description. Resumes and job descriptions are processed, converted into feature vectors using TF-IDF, and then scored for similarity using cosine similarity. The system helps recruiters quickly identify the most relevant candidates.

**Features:**
- Clean and preprocess resume and job description text
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Resume ranking based on similarity to job requirements
- Example code for running in Google Colab or locally
- Easy to adapt for different job roles or datasets

**How to use:**
1. Paste your resumes and job description into the notebook or script.
2. Run the code to get ranked scores for each resume.
3. Customize and extend for your own recruitment needs.

**Dataset:**  
You can use sample resumes from [Kaggle Resume Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/resume-dataset) or your own data.
